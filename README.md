# Loan-Default-Prediction

Welcome to the Loan Default Prediction Project! This project tackles one of the most industry-relevant machine learning problems: predicting loan defaults. Financial loan services are vital across various sectors, and minimizing payment defaults is a crucial objective for companies offering such services. Machine learning plays a pivotal role in identifying individuals at high risk of defaulting, enabling proactive interventions to mitigate financial risks.In this project, we will step into the shoes of a data scientist at a major financial institution leveraging machine learning techniques to predict loan defaults accurately.

The datasets are samples of past borrowers of a financial institution that contain information about the individual and the specific loan. One dataset is titled train.csv and the other is titled test.csv.train.csv contains 70% of the overall sample (255,347 borrowers to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether or not the borrower has defaulted on their loan payments (the “ground truth”).The test.csv dataset contains the exact same information about the remaining segment of the overall sample (109,435 borrowers to be exact), but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each borrower.
